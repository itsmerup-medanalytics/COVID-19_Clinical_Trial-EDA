# COVID19-Clinical-Trial-EDA

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Clinical Trial data to understand global research trends during the pandemic. The analysis focuses on study status, phases, enrollment size, funding sources, sponsors, eligibility criteria, and outcome measures.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains detailed information about COVID-19 clinical trials including:
- Trial status (Completed, Recruiting, Terminated, etc.)
- Study type (Interventional, Observational, etc.)
- Clinical trial phase
- Enrollment numbers
- Sponsors and collaborators
- Gender eligibility
- Funding sources
- Outcome measures

## Analysis Performed
- Distribution of clinical trial status
- Study type distribution
- Clinical trial phase distribution
- Enrollment size distribution
- Statistical summary of enrollment data
- Top 10 sponsors/collaborators
- Gender eligibility distribution
- Funding source distribution
- Top 5 outcome measures
- Trials focusing on mortality-related outcomes

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Most trials are open to all genders, showing inclusive eligibility criteria.
- A large proportion of studies are interventional in nature.
- Trials span across multiple phases, reflecting vaccine and drug development stages.
- Enrollment sizes vary significantly across studies.
- Industry and government bodies play major roles in funding.
- Mortality remains a key outcome measure in several trials.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights the scale, diversity, and progression of COVID-19 clinical research worldwide. It provides valuable insights into study design, funding patterns, and research focus areas during the pandemic
